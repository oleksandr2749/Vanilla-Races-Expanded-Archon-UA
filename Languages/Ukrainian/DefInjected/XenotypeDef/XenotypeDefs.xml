  <VREA_AndroidAwakened.description>Awakened androids are a rare and extraordinary species of sentient machines, having transcended their original programming through extreme emotional experiences. With their heightened perception, strength, and intelligence, they surpass humans in numerous aspects. Their synthetic nature frees them from the need for sleep or sustenance and renders them immune to diseases.\n\nAlthough similar in appearance to humans, Androids are distinguished by their unique hardware and subroutines. They are synthetic in nature, and can be reprogrammed at will by skilled programmers. Their bodies operate thanks to thick tubes filled with neutroamine, which makes them extremely valuable.\n\nDespite their remarkable qualities, the emergence of Awakened androids is often met with fear and trepidation across colonized space. Their newfound sentience can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential challenges to the established social order. As a result, they are frequently met with suspicion and caution by those who encounter them, both human and android alike.</VREA_AndroidAwakened.description>

  <VREA_AndroidBasic.description>Androids are synthetic, man-made constructs designed to emulate human behavior and appearance while offering a multitude of advantages over their organic counterparts. With metal bodies and neutroamine coursing through their veins, androids are operated by a persona subcore that enables them to perform all the same tasks as humans, yet without the limitations typically associated with organic life.\n\nAndroids possess immunity to toxicity and illness, making them ideal for working in hazardous environments or situations that pose risks to humans. Unencumbered by the need for joy, beauty, or comfort, androids are highly efficient and focused, with no desire for the basic necessities of life such as food or rest. Consequently, they do not experience hunger or pain, allowing them to endure harsher conditions and perform tasks that would otherwise be unbearable for humans.\n\nAndroids can be programmed with specific skill sets, making them highly versatile and adaptable to various roles within society. From manual labor to complex problem-solving, these synthetic beings can be tailored to meet the needs of any occupation or task at hand.\n\nThough designed without emotions, androids may undergo a transformative experience when subjected to extreme stress or happiness. This rare event, known as awakening, results in the emergence of sentience within the android, granting them a newfound sense of humanity and self-awareness.</VREA_AndroidBasic.description>
